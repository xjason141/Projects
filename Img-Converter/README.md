This is the first mini project for the final course of the Python course I'm currently taking.
Problem statement: You received a folder of images but with the wrong format, size, orientation.
Task: Format the images to '.jpg', rotate (-90), size(128,128). Formatted images are to be saved in 'opt/icons/'.
This is a completed task. To see what happens, please delete the 'opt' directory before running the app.
