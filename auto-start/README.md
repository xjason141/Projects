This script was created to automatically open up files that I frequently use during internship, and my default browser (Firefox) that goes straight to Google Maps.

The script is then moved to 'Startup' folder in Windows, causing the script to be executed on startup.

However, the script takes quite a while to be executed. Either due to how Python works, or due to hardware constraint, or both.
